#+TITLE: Clearfile

Clearfile intends to augment your physical clearfile. It uses[[https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract][
tesseract]] optical character recognition to digitally curate your
clearfile into a searchable digital database.

* Why use a digital clearfile?
Clearfiles are an excellent way to store physical documents for long
periods of time without damaging them. Yet they are often difficult to
manage, leading to the inevitable scenario of dozens of pages stuffed
into a few clearfile sleeves. Worse still they're unsearchable in any
capacity, finding that all important hand out on differential
equations couldn't be more difficult. The digital clearfile uses the power of
optical character recognition to give you some semblance of sanity in
this so often desperately unorganized mess. Hopefully with the
addition of tagging and notebooks, high order structure can help you
find what you're looking for faster. Because the images are digital in
nature, they can be synced without weight, kept away from sun, rain,
and accidental cleanups, generally last longer than their physical
counterparts.

Naturally this won't replace forms you need to sign - somethings truly
are best kept on paper - but the idea is to transition as much as you
can from the unorganized physical word into the higher order
abstraction and search-ability of the digital one.

* Installation

Installing clearfile is relatively simple, clone the directory and then install
the dependencies using pip:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  pip install pytesseract numpy opencv-python flask fuzzywuzzy rake_nltk pillow pyenchant
#+END_SRC

Note that if you are installing clearfile on something like a Raspberry Pi
opencv will not be available through pip. Just leave out the package from the
dependency list and compile your own copy of opencv manually.

After this you are done, you can test the project with =flask= if you wish to from
the root directory.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  # Leave out the 0.0.0.0 bit if you only want to view it on your own computer
  FLASK_APP=clearfile/clearfile flask run --host 0.0.0.0
#+END_SRC

Running this should bring up a web page with 'No Notes.' in the centre.

* Usage

Usage is pretty simple, click the teal upload button to add an image to your
clearfile. Use the search bar up top to search through the text of all your
notes, and you'll get all the relevant results sorted by their match to your
query. Tags appear underneath the image to try and give you an idea of what's in
the image, think of it like a word cloud so you can prompt your memory on old
notes without having to open and read them. If you find a tag unhelpful or
non-descriptive, click the "x" to remove them from that note. View and Delete
are self-explanatory click on them to view or delete a note respectively. The
interface is deigned to be as intuitive and out of the way as possible,
focusing more on getting the text analysis right than anything else.
